Our server uses port number 51069.

While we have not quite decided how our GUI will be set up, the following is a high-level description of how a user will use our webservice. Basically, the user will access the website and identify himself using the URL (for the time being; we may add some other method instead later). He will then be presented with some information about a recommended recipe, a link to find out more, and the ability to rate the recipe. From here, the user will be able to either move ahead to the next recipe, or to search one or more ingredients. If the user moves on, the next page is just another recipe with the same options. If he searches, the website will continue with the same basic format, but using only recipes that contain the ingredient(s) that the user searched for. There will also be a way to add a new recipe, though we have not determined what that will look like.
